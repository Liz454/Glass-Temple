            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>We are a relatively new nursery specialising in exotic tropical Frangipani and Adenium.</p>
            <p>
            The Frangipani is  commonly referred to as "Plumeria" throughout the Americas and also as the "Temple Flower" alluding to its place of origin,  the Central Americas.  It is after this more romantic name that we have named our business, "Glass Temple Nurseries".
            </p><p>
            Here at Glass Temple, our greenhouses are our temples - places of solitude and balance, harmony and beauty. The greenhouse is the new Temple for many people around the globe,  capable of providing sustenance for life and marking a return to the fundamentals of living on Earth.
            </p><p>
            Our greenhouses are in two locations in the Franklin district of Auckland. All of our plants are initially grown in greenhouses as they are tropical by nature.  This, however, does not mean that the Frangipani or the Adenium is hard to grow.  Both are very hardy plants that can live outside for most of the year throughout New Zealand and in the warmer parts of Auckland, and further North can grow outside in the garden year round. Our one year olds are transferred outside into a sheltered nursery after their first dormancy.  Further South than Auckland or during Winter they do extremely well as potted plants. Both Frangipani and Adenium enjoy a  free draining potting mix. Only moderate watering is required throughout Summer and no watering during Winter dormancy.  Come Spring they will come away again bursting forth with leaf and flower.
            </p><p>
            The Frangipani is well known for its powerful fragrance making it a wonderful addition to the home patio.  It is the flower used in leis and conjures up images of tropical paradises and endless Summers making it the ideal gift!  The hard to come by Adenium is a spectacular and odd looking plant which when in flower will take your breath away making it the perfect gift for even the fussiest.</p>

                <div class="col-8">
                    <h2>For your frangipani</h2>
                    <p>In Winter you will receive your Frangipani as a dormant branch with only a holding medium to protect its roots in transit.  It will need to be potted into a nice free draining soil.  We have our own special mix available for purchase to use in patio pots. If you receive your plant already potted, it will already be in this mix and will need no further potting for a further 12 months.  </p>
                    <p>While your plant is actively growing, water it when it gets dry and then allow to dry out again before further watering.  A general purpose fertiliser can be used after the first 6 months to help encourage flowering.  The first months will be covered by a quick release fertiliser already in the mix.
                    Keep your plant in a nice sunny, sheltered position where it will get at least 8 full hours of sun each day.</p>
                    <p>As the weather gets cooler, you will notice that growth will start to slow down and the leaves may start to drop, depending on where it is located. At this point it may be brought inside to overwinter.  Reduce watering right back to once a week and then withhold entirely if there has been total leaf loss.  If this happens, it is perfectly normal.  All it means is that the plant has gone into dormancy.  It will require no special attention at this stage and can even be stored in a back room out of direct light. If your plant is planted in the garden it will need to be in a frost free area to overwinter.  It is fine to dig it up and bring it inside if necessary.</p>
                    <p>As the weather warms again, the plant will grow new leaves from the tip.  At this point it can be brought out into pride of place in a nice sunny spot and will appreciate small amounts of water to help wake it up.  Flowers may develop on some of the branch tips.  These will open over Summer.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <h2>For your adenium</h2>
                    <p>Your Adenium will be shipped already potted in a free draining medium containing both quick release and slow release fertilisers. It can stay in this pot as long as you wish.</p><p> Adenium, unlike most other plants, will do well pot bound. By allowing this to happen, you will notice the fleshy caudex will increase dramatically in size giving your plant its own special character. If you desire a larger sized plant, then repot into a new pot the following Spring. If you wish you can raise the plant another 2-3 cm above the level of the soil to reveal more of the fleshy caudex.</p>
                    <p>Keep in a nice sunny position and water whenever the mix dries out.  The plant will not suffer too much if it stays dry for too long. Like most succulents, the Adenium can store water and will just rely on this. </p>

                        <li><button onClick="showFAQ(1)">Can you grow Frangipanis outside in New Zealand?</button>
                        </li><p id="faq1" class="hidden">Frangipanis may be grown outside in New Zealand in frost free areas including Auckland and Northland. Further south, they do well in pots in conservatories and sunrooms. During Summer, they will enjoy being put outside.</p>

                        <li><button onClick="showFAQ(2)">Why is my Frangipani losing its leaves?</button>
                        </li><p id="faq2" class="hidden">Frangipanis go dormant in areas that experience cold Winters. You may notice during late Autumn that your plant starts to lose its leaves. This is normal. If this happens, move your Frangipani to a sheltered spot away from frosts. Withhold water so that it does not rot. In Springtime, your plant will spring back to life.</p>

                        <li><button onClick="showFAQ(3)">How much water should I give my Frangipani?</button>
                        </li><p id="faq3" class="hidden">During Winter, dormant Frangipani need no water. If if retains its leaves, in a warm conservatory for instance, just continue with very light watering throughout Winter.
                        During Summer, water whenever the mix starts to dry out. In a small pot during the heat of Summer this may be every day. In a larger pot or in the ground this will be less frequent.</p>

                        <li><button onClick="showFAQ(4)">What is the best fertiliser to use on my Frangipani?</button>
                        </li><p id="faq4" class="hidden">A young plant will need a good balanced slow release fertiliser for optimum growth. Once it is of flowering age, use a good slow release flowering fertiliser with some extra Phosphorus.</p>

                        <li><button onClick="showFAQ(5)">Which is the best potting mix for Frangipani and Adenium?</button>
                        </li><p id="faq5" class="hidden">Both Frangipani and Adenium require a good free draining potting mix. Do not place a base under the pot as the water must be allowed to drain away. We have a mix that we can supply if required.</p>

                        <li><button onClick="showFAQ(6)">Can my Adenium be planted outside?</button>
                        </li><p id="faq6" class="hidden">If you have a sunny area that is frost free then your Adenium can go outside. Make sure that the ground is free draining. The Adeniums we sell have been developed in small, shallow pots to get the maximum caudex growth. They can be left in these pots if you want to continue to restrict the growth.</p>

                        <li><button onClick="showFAQ(7)">How often should I repot my Adenium?</button>
                        </li><p id="faq7" class="hidden">Your Adenium can be repotted each Spring into a fresh free draining mix. Either trim the roots if you want to keep it in the same pot or go one pot size up and raise the caudex a a cm or so above the soil line.</p>

If this happens, it is perfectly normal.  All it means is that the plant has gone into dormancy.  It will require no special attention at this stage and can even be stored in a back room out of direct light. If your plant is planted in the garden it will need to be in a frost free area to overwinter.  It is fine to dig it up and bring it inside if necessary.</p>
                    <p>As the weather warms again, the plant will grow new leaves from the tip.  At this point it can be brought out into pride of place in a nice sunny spot and will appreciate small amounts of water to help wake it up.  Flowers may develop on some of the branch tips.  These will open over Summer.</p>

                    <h2>For your adenium</h2>
                    <p>Your Adenium will be shipped already potted in a free draining medium containing both quick release and slow release fertilisers. It can stay in this pot as long as you wish.  Adenium, unlike most other plants, will do well pot bound. By allowing this to happen, you will notice the fleshy caudex will increase dramatically in size giving your plant its own special character. If you desire a larger sized plant, then repot into a new pot the following Spring. If you wish you can raise the plant another 2-3 cm above the level of the soil to reveal more of the fleshy caudex.</p>
                    <p>Keep in a nice sunny position and water whenever the mix dries out.  The plant will not suffer too much if it stays dry for too long. Like most succulents, the Adenium can store water and will just rely on this. </p>
